# IBM Cloud COS NFS Gateway Architecture

## Overview

IBM Cloud COS NFS Gateway exposes a single IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket as an
NFSv4 filesystem by default, with optional NFSv3 compatibility. Linux clients
speak NFS to the gateway; the gateway translates filesystem operations into COS
object operations and uses local disk for staging, write-back sync, and read
caching.

For a direct comparison with AWS's newer S3 file-access direction, see
[`docs/AWS_S3_FILES_COMPARISON.md`](docs/AWS_S3_FILES_COMPARISON.md).

The current architecture is intentionally centered on local correctness:

- Writes are accepted into local staging first.
- Background workers sync dirty staged files to COS asynchronously.
- Read paths prefer dirty/staged data when present, then local cache, then COS.
- Object-side COS changes converge through cache expiry or optional refresh
  scans.
- Backpressure protects staging capacity before the local filesystem is full.
- Multipart uploads are owned by final sync workers and protected from
  per-object races.
- Crash recovery scans staging metadata and resumes unsynced dirty files.

## Request Flow

### NFS Layer

The gateway serves NFSv4 over TCP by default, normally on port `2049`. It can
also serve NFSv3 or dual NFSv3/NFSv4 from the same listener when configured.
The NFS stack is built on a vendored `go-nfs` dependency with local changes
needed for gateway behavior, including filesystem statistics forwarding,
NFSv4 COMPOUND handling, and deterministic ENOSPC mapping.

The request path is:

1. NFS client sends an NFSv4 COMPOUND request or an enabled NFSv3 operation.
2. `go-nfs` decodes the request.
3. wrapper handlers apply caching, instrumentation, and stable directory
   verifier behavior.
4. `COSFilesystem` handles filesystem semantics.
5. operations are routed to staging, cache, or COS depending on file state.

### Write Path

Writes use local staging when `staging.enabled` is true.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as NFS client
    participant F as COSFilesystem
    participant B as Backpressure
    participant S as Staging manager
    participant W as Sync worker
    participant O as COS

    C->>F: WRITE(path, offset, bytes)
    F->>B: reserve requested bytes
    B-->>F: allow, block, or reject
    F->>S: write bytes into staging file
    S-->>F: mark dirty
    F-->>C: NFS write response
    S->>W: enqueue or discover dirty file
    W->>O: upload full staged object
    O-->>W: object stored
    W->>S: mark clean and cleanup if configured
```

An accepted write means the gateway accepted data into local staging. It does
not mean the object is already durable in COS. COS durability happens after the
background sync worker uploads the staged file and the object is visible in the
bucket.

Dirty files are tracked by staging metadata. Sync can be triggered by size,
dirty age, close behavior, explicit queueing, or periodic scans depending on
configuration.

### Read Path

Reads follow a consistency-first order:

1. If a file is dirty, syncing, or otherwise has active staged state, read from
   staging.
2. If the requested range exists in the local chunk cache, read from cache.
3. Otherwise fetch from COS using object/range reads.
4. Populate the chunk cache when configured.

Sequential COS reads can use read-ahead and parallel range fetches. Repeated
concurrent fetches for the same range are deduplicated with singleflight to
avoid stampeding COS.

### Directory And Metadata Path

Object keys are translated into filesystem paths. Directory listings are
constructed from COS prefix listings plus local staged state. Metadata cache
entries store file attributes and directory listings with TTL-based expiration.

Write, remove, rename, and metadata-changing operations invalidate relevant
cache entries so clients do not keep reading stale metadata through the gateway.
Mutations invalidate the target path, affected parent and ancestor directory
listings, and affected data cache entries. Directory rename and delete also
invalidate cached data under the affected prefixes so range/chunk reads do not
serve stale bytes through old logical paths.

### Object-Side Refresh Path

Direct changes made in COS by tools outside the gateway are discovered in two
ways:

1. normal metadata and directory cache TTL expiry followed by fresh COS stat or
   prefix-list operations.
2. optional periodic refresh scans configured by `object_refresh`.

The refresh scanner performs a COS `ListObjectsV2` over the configured prefix
and compares the current in-memory object signatures with the previous scan.
The signature is the object's key, size, ETag, and last-modified time as exposed
by COS listing. When a clean object's signature is created, changed, or removed,
the scanner invalidates:

- the file metadata cache entry.
- the parent directory listing cache entry.
- the local data cache entries for that object.

The scanner intentionally does not fetch object data and does not write COS
data into staging files. Its first successful scan establishes the in-memory
base observation. If a later scan sees the same key created, updated, or deleted
while that path has dirty local staged data, the gateway records a staging
conflict instead of uploading the stale local copy. Conflict recording copies
the local dirty file under `staging.root_dir/lost+found/`, writes a JSON sidecar
describing the object-side change, removes the original path from the dirty sync
queue, invalidates caches, and leaves the COS/object-store state as the default
winner for that path. If conflict recording fails, refresh keeps the older
dirty-path skip behavior and avoids overwriting the local staged bytes. Parent
listings may still be invalidated so unrelated object-side directory changes
can converge; non-conflicted dirty staged files are merged back into listings by
the NFS/staging layer.

Deletion detection is in-memory and practical rather than database-backed. A
delete is detected when an object seen in a previous scan is missing from the
current scan. Deletes for objects the scanner has never observed still converge
through normal cache expiry and subsequent COS stat/list misses.

## Core Components

### `cmd/nfs-gateway`

The executable loads configuration, initializes logging, COS, caches, staging,
sync workers, health endpoints, metrics, debug endpoints, and the NFS server.

Configuration can be provided by YAML and overridden with environment variables
using the `NFS_GATEWAY_` prefix.

### `internal/nfs`

This package adapts NFS requests to the internal filesystem implementation.

Responsibilities include:

- NFS server startup.
- NFS operation handling through `COSFilesystem`.
- stable verifier handling for directory pagination.
- instrumentation wrappers.
- filesystem statistics forwarding so clients can see staging-aware capacity.
- dirty-file read routing through staged state.

### `internal/posix`

This package implements object-backed POSIX-style operations:

- `Stat`, `Read`, `Write`, `Delete`, `Mkdir`, `Rmdir`, `Rename`, and `SetAttr`.
- COS object key/path translation.
- metadata encoding and decoding.
- range and whole-object reads.
- chunk-cache and metadata-cache integration.
- singleflight deduplication for concurrent COS range fetches.
- object-side refresh scans and clean-cache invalidation.

When staging is enabled, the primary write path is handled by `internal/nfs` and
`internal/staging`; the POSIX handler remains responsible for COS-backed reads,
metadata, legacy paths, and object operations.

### `internal/staging`

The staging subsystem is the center of write-back behavior.

Main responsibilities:

- create and manage one local staging session per logical path.
- write incoming NFS data to local staging files.
- track dirty files and dirty bytes.
- apply high/critical watermark backpressure.
- expose pressure and queue state to metrics/debug endpoints.
- recover dirty files after process restart.
- coordinate cleanup after successful sync.
- protect active readers and active multipart uploads from premature cleanup.

The staging directory must be treated as durable local state until sync has
completed. Losing dirty staging files before upload can lose accepted writes.

### `internal/staging/sync_worker`

Sync workers upload dirty staged files to COS. They process queued and scanned
dirty files, retry transient failures, and record upload timing.

For large files, sync workers use multipart upload. Multipart lifecycle is
managed as one active upload session per object sync attempt:

- create multipart upload.
- upload parts with ordered part numbers.
- track ETags.
- complete exactly once when all parts are uploaded and the staged snapshot is
  still current.
- abort failed or stale attempts when safe.
- restart from a clean multipart upload if COS reports an invalid upload
  session such as `NoSuchUpload`.

Per-object synchronization prevents multiple workers from syncing the same path
at the same time.

### `internal/cache`

The cache subsystem has two layers:

- Metadata cache: in-memory LRU with TTL for attributes and directory entries.
- Data cache: local disk chunk cache for object ranges.

The data cache is optimized for repeated and sequential reads. It is not the
durability mechanism for writes; that role belongs to staging.

### `internal/cos`

The COS client wraps IBM Cloud COS S3-compatible operations:

- object stat/head.
- object get and range get.
- put object.
- delete object.
- list objects by prefix.
- multipart create/upload-part/complete/abort.

Authentication supports IAM API key and HMAC credentials according to
configuration.

### `internal/metrics` And `internal/health`

The gateway exposes optional HTTP endpoints for operations:

- Prometheus metrics on `127.0.0.1:<metrics_port>/metrics`.
- health endpoints on `127.0.0.1:<health_port>/health/*`.
- debug endpoints on `127.0.0.1:<debug_port>/debug/*`.

The debug staging endpoint reports dirty files, sync queue depth, queue bytes,
staging pressure, conflict count, conflicted paths, last conflict time, last sync
timing, COS visibility latency, and upload throughput.

## Staging Backpressure

Backpressure is enforced before staging is full. The gateway computes staging
pressure from configured size limits and current staged bytes.

Pressure levels:

- `normal`: writes are allowed.
- `high`: block mode can wait for sync drain before allowing more writes.
- `critical`: writes are rejected early or fail after the configured wait
  timeout.

Modes:

- `block`: wait for pressure relief until `backpressure_wait_timeout`.
- `fail_fast`: reject immediately at or above the critical watermark.

Backpressure decisions are logged with:

- path.
- requested bytes.
- available bytes.
- pressure level.
- decision: `allow`, `block`, or `reject`.

NFS filesystem statistics are staging-aware, so clients can see reduced
available space before staging is fully exhausted.

## Crash Safety Model

Crash safety is based on preserving local staging state.

Accepted writes remain dirty until sync completes. On restart, the gateway scans
staging metadata and active staging files, rebuilds the dirty index, and resumes
sync. If a crash happens during multipart upload, the gateway does not rely on
the old in-memory upload state; it starts a clean sync attempt from the staged
file.

This model depends on:

- reliable local storage for `staging.root_dir`.
- not deleting staging files manually while they are dirty.
- keeping `clean_after_sync` cleanup limited to files that are already clean and
  no longer needed by active handles.

## Consistency Model

The gateway provides local read-after-write consistency through staging: a
client that writes a file can read the dirty version from the gateway before COS
sync completes.

For object-side changes made directly in COS:

- Clean cached metadata and directory listings converge after
  `cache.metadata.ttl_seconds`, or sooner when `object_refresh.enabled` is true
  and a refresh scan observes a changed object list signature.
- The NFS directory wrapper has its own short listing TTL, so a mounted client
  may observe a refreshed POSIX listing only after that wrapper entry expires.
- Clean cached data is invalidated by refresh when the object's key, size, ETag,
  or last-modified time changes in COS list results.
- Dirty staged files remain authoritative for reads, stats, and listings on the
  gateway until refresh observes an external COS change for the same key. In
  that conflict case, refresh preserves the local staged bytes under
  `lost+found`, blocks upload of the stale staged copy, invalidates caches, and
  makes COS the default winner for the original path.
- Object deletions are detected by refresh only after the scanner has observed
  the object in a previous scan. Otherwise deletes converge through ordinary
  cache expiry and fresh COS misses.
- COS user metadata changes are detected by refresh when they also change the
  listed signature, commonly last-modified time after copy-to-self metadata
  updates. Otherwise user metadata changes converge through metadata cache TTL.

The supported write ownership model is one gateway owning writes for a mounted
export. Direct COS writes are treated as external changes that clean gateway
caches can learn about; simultaneous active/active writers still need external
coordination.

COS is still an object store, so some filesystem operations are approximations:

- file rename is copy to the new object key followed by delete of the old key.
  It is not atomic. If copy fails, the source remains and a destination may or
  may not have been created by COS. If delete fails after copy succeeds, both
  keys may exist; the gateway does not delete the destination as rollback.
- directory rename is a best-effort recursive prefix copy followed by source
  deletes only after all listed copies succeed. It is not atomic. Copy failure
  leaves source keys in place and any already copied destination keys in place.
  Delete failure after copy can leave both prefixes populated. Existing
  destination directories are rejected to avoid implicit merges, and renaming a
  directory into its own subtree is rejected.
- dirty staged files are durable local state until sync completes. Delete of a
  dirty staged file succeeds with POSIX write-back semantics: a durable
  tombstone is persisted first, staged bytes are discarded, and the COS object
  is deleted (by the sync worker after any in-flight upload finishes, retried
  until confirmed). Tombstones survive restarts, so an accepted delete never
  resurrects; recreating the path cancels its tombstone. Rename of a dirty
  staged file also succeeds: the staged bytes and dirty bookkeeping re-key to
  the destination (the destination sidecar is persisted before the byte move,
  the source tombstone after it, so no crash window loses data), the moved
  bytes sync to the destination key, and the source object is retired by its
  tombstone. Renaming a clean file over a destination whose staged bytes are
  mid-upload is rejected as busy. Directory rename is rejected when dirty
  staged children exist under the source or destination tree, and rmdir is
  rejected while dirty staged children exist.
- `mkdir` creates a trailing-slash marker object. `rmdir` deletes that marker
  only when the gateway's current listing sees the directory as empty. Implicit
  directories are derived from object key prefixes.
- hard links are not supported as native object-store constructs.
- generated file identity is based on path/object metadata rather than true
  persistent inode allocation from COS.
- multi-gateway active/active writes to the same bucket are not a supported
  consistency model unless external coordination is added.

## Deployment Model

The gateway can run directly on a Linux host, in Docker, or in Kubernetes. The
most important deployment requirement is persistent local storage for staging
and adequate local storage for cache.

Recommended production shape:

- one gateway instance owns one mounted export.
- staging path on reliable local or attached disk.
- cache path on local or attached disk sized for the read working set.
- NFS port exposed only to trusted clients.
- COS credentials provided through environment variables, local secret files,
  or Kubernetes secrets.
- metrics, health, and debug endpoints kept on localhost or protected networks.

Container and Kubernetes examples live under `deployments/`, but they are
deployment templates rather than a complete production platform.

## Security Boundaries

The gateway assumes the operator controls the Linux host or network where NFS is
mounted. NFS access is not authenticated by the gateway itself. Access control
must be provided by host firewall rules, VPC security groups, Kubernetes network
policy, private networking, or equivalent infrastructure controls.

COS access is authenticated with the configured IBM Cloud credentials. Those
credentials should be scoped to the target bucket and stored outside source
control.

COS API traffic uses HTTPS through the IBM COS SDK. NFS traffic is plain NFS
and should be kept on trusted networks.

## Benchmark Architecture

The formal benchmark suite runs outside the gateway against a mounted export.
It records human-readable summaries, JSON, CSV, baseline files, environment
capture, and monitor samples.

Benchmark categories cover:

- frontend write performance.
- time-to-durable in COS and sync throughput.
- cold and warm reads.
- range, random, and large sequential reads.
- backpressure behavior.
- small-file workloads.
- crash safety.
- mixed dirty-read and concurrent workloads.

See `docs/BENCHMARK_SUITE.md` for benchmark operation details.
